# deep-learning-a-1

The project was done under the course CS7910- 'Fundamentals of Deep Learning' taught by the Prof. Mithesh Kabhra.	
It was a team project.


The aim of this project was to understand the actual working of a simple neural network. This was facilated by restricting the use of libraries only to numpy.
The neural network uses object oriented programming.
The simple neural network consist of forward propogation, backward propogation,application of optimizers, varing the weight initializers, and use of combinations of hyperparameters to gain best validation accuracy.
